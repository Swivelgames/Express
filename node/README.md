# Getting Started

- **`example.expr`** - Main Express Source File
- **`grammar/`** - Contains `Collector` and `Token` classes
- **`runner.js`** - Edit this file to change the `starting Collector`

You'll need `node` and `yarn`. Install node from the website, then run this for `yarn`:

```
npm i -g yarn
```

Then install dependencies:
```
yarn
```

# (Run) Compile Your Express Script

To compile the `example.expr` file, run:

```
./main.js
```
